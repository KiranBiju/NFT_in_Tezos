# NFT_in_Tezos

It's a NFT collection created by me on Tezos Ghost testnet.

It can be given to any authorities like NSS to grant it as a reward on an activity involving planting trees.

Since it concerns about the nature , we use Tezos blockchain for creating the NFT collectibles as Tezos has become one of the most popular blockchains for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thanks to its fast, cheap, and low gas transactions.

Tezos allows the environment to be green by consuming less energy and power, which makes it environmental friendly and better than other blockchains.
